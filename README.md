A small project for a proof of concept for a table manager. 
Mainly for me to familiarize with the idea, and see what 
design approaches we should take before implementing this 
in the real application.

A small library that I personally use now for my applications
was made from this. You can investigate psyomn/turntables if 
you have nothing better to do.
